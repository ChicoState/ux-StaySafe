# Stay Safe

Stay Safe is an application intended to assist with assessing crimes and crime rate of your current area, or whatever area that you provide to the application. It allows users to view and be notified of crimes near their location, with an adjustable range to accommodate your needs. It can be used for research purposes as well, with the ability to check an area and any crimes commited within that space for the last week, month, year, whatever you desire of it. It helps you stay informed about your location and provide you with information that you need about an area you might be curious about.

# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**

Initial research and designing for Stay Safe focused on users being able to easily access crime activity, and staying updated on activity in their local area. These updates persist when the person is possibly moving/traveling, ensuring to keep them safe.

- Competitive analysis helped us set the groundwork for what our app should contain, as well as issues to avoid in the design process:
  - **Subscription Costs:** Numerous features were locked behind a paywall, leading to an overall worse experience if you don't pay.
  - **Inconsistency:** Some competitors had out of date or incorrect information regarding crime reports. Sometimes a crime wouldn't be properly recorded, or a notification would come several days after the incident was resolved.
  - **False Reporting:** In some cases, a false report would occur. These reports would contain personal data as well, listed on the application for anyone to see. These potential safety breaches were a large point of concern in reviews.
- Heuristic evaluation gave us insight on what a strong user experience should look like, looking at a higher end competitor for this evaluation. It did manage to highlight some key weaknesses to take note of, however:
  - A minimalist design could lead to **difficulties when navigating through the application**.
  - The subscription model wasn't entirely clear on benefits, with inconsistent usage of the "Plus" and "Premium" labeling, leading to **confusion on what each model uniquely provided for benefits**.
- With our research and findings, we created some personas and scenarios to represent likely customers, and a situation where they'd have been better off using our product. These highlighted what users needed from our product:
  - An **easy-to-use platform** for real-time crime information and updates.
  - Accessibility for features, **avoiding large and restrictive paywalls**.
  - **Improved accuracy** for crimes reports, as well as **more consistent and timely reporting**.
- Initial sketches and design concepts illustrated:
  - a clear, straightforward, **easy to understand UI**.
  - Improved/enhanced user control and accessibility for **alerts and browsing crime data**.
  - **Transparency regarding navigation and user offerings** within the application.

# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

**Executive Summary**

The second phase of Stay Safe’s development has focused on refining wireframes to enhance user experience and ensure accessibility of key features. This stage involved multiple research methods to identify design improvements before moving into full development.

- **Cognitive walkthroughs:** Provided hands-on testing to assess ease of navigation and feature clarity.
  - **Key actions:** Testers found the screens intuitive, confirming that users can easily navigate between pages, ensuring an accessible, user-friendly design.
  - **Missing Features:** Notable gaps in features were brought to our attention, such as crime-type filtering and time-based data. These features were mentioned in our user persona that was tested but was nowhere to be found in our wireframe. Addressing these gaps would help to align the product with user needs.
- **Informal feedback:** We provided questions to the SE team for their demo and received feedback that gave us insight on additional potential features that would improve the user experience and enhance user engagement.
  - **Crime-type disaggregation:**  Allow users to select the types of crimes they want to see and differentiate them visually on the map, to improve the relevancy of alerts to the user.
  - **Accessible crime data:** Providing users with an easy way to view historical crime data to view trends of an area, staying informed about an area they might be concerned about.
- After these methods of research, modifications were made to our wireframes to account for features that were missing initially.
  - Time frame slider for crime alerts to **expand the viewability of crimes to multiple days** since they initially happened.
  - Crime category settings to **allow users to select which crimes they want to be alerted about**.
  - A feature suggestion box was added in our support page as well, located within the settings, to **allow users to submit requests for extra features to allow us to keep gathering feedback** on where we could improve.

All of these research methods and tweaks served to refine Stay Safe as much as possible and prepare it for the upcoming prototype that we’ll develop. These refinements ensure that Stay Safe will provide an excellent user experience and remain competitive within the respective market.
