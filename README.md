# Stay Safe

Stay Safe is an application intended to assist with assessing crimes and crime rate of your current area, or whatever area that you provide to the application. It allows users to view and be notified of crimes near their location, with an adjustable range to accommodate your needs. It can be used for research purposes as well, with the ability to check an area and any crimes commited within that space for the last week, month, year, whatever you desire of it. It helps you stay informed about your location and provide you with information that you need about an area you might be curious about.

# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**

Initial research and designing for Stay Safe focused on users being able to easily access crime activity, and staying updated on activity in their local area. These updates persist when the person is possibly moving/traveling, ensuring to keep them safe.

- Competitive analysis helped us set the groundwork for what our app should contain, as well as issues to avoid in the design process:
  - **Subscription Costs:** Numerous features were locked behind a paywall, leading to an overall worse experience if you don't pay.
  - **Inconsistency:** Some competitors had out of date or incorrect information regarding crime reports. Sometimes a crime wouldn't be properly recorded, or a notification would come several days after the incident was resolved.
  - **False Reporting:** In some cases, a false report would occur. These reports would contain personal data as well, listed on the application for anyone to see. These potential safety breaches were a large point of concern in reviews.
- Heuristic evaluation gave us insight on what a strong user experience should look like, looking at a higher end competitor for this evaluation. It did manage to highlight some key weaknesses to take note of, however:
  - A minimalist design could lead to **difficulties when navigating through the application**.
  - The subscription model wasn't entirely clear on benefits, with inconsistent usage of the "Plus" and "Premium" labeling, leading to **confusion on what each model uniquely provided for benefits**.
- With our research and findings, we created some personas and scenarios to represent likely customers, and a situation where they'd have been better off using our product. These highlighted what users needed from our product:
  - An **easy-to-use platform** for real-time crime information and updates.
  - Accessibility for features, **avoiding large and restrictive paywalls**.
  - **Improved accuracy** for crimes reports, as well as **more consistent and timely reporting**.
- Initial sketches and design concepts illustrated:
  - a clear, straightforward, **easy to understand UI**.
  - Improved/enhanced user control and accessibility for **alerts and browsing crime data**.
  - **Transparency regarding navigation and user offerings** within the application.
