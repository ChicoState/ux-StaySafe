Travis

27 year old living in Berkley, California

Marketing Manager at Lob

B.A. in Marketing

Travis works at Lob, which is located in San Francisco. He lives in Berkley, and is required to commute every day to his job. He’s got a regular route that he takes in order to get where he needs to go, but he’ll encounter trouble sometimes with the areas he drives through.

He’s had a few close calls on his way to work, due to some careless drivers.

Goals
- Make sure his current route doesn’t have any traffic/crime issues so he doesn’t waste time.
- Ensure he’s safe during his daily commute. 
- Find alternative routes that provide a safer driving environment while still letting him get to work on time.

# Scenarios

## Joseph
Joseph and his family decide to eat out for dinner one night. The restaurant they have in mind is across town. Upon their arrival, there’s a few cop cars outside the building. There was an incident between 2 customers, leading to the police being called. The restaurant is closed for now while the police sort things out. It occurred just a few minutes after they left, so they were unaware of this. They turn around and leave, needing to find another place to eat.

## Bobby
Bobby found a potential tenant that is very wealthy, but only wants to live in a safe neighborhood. Bobby ensures to the tenant that it’s a safe neighborhood, but the tenant does not believe him. The tenant demands proof. Bobby provides past data for the tenant, but the tenant says it’s outdated. Bobby needs to find a way to provide the tenant with up-to-date crime stats or he could use him as a tenant.

## Travis
Travis is driving back home from work, taking his usual route. At a particular intersection, he sees that it’s been blocked off due to an accident occurring right in the middle of it. He’s forced to either turn around or turn right and continue his way home on a different path.

## Molly
Molly decided to run with her friend as she is also a pro runner. Molly’s friend wants to run a different route that she found on social media so she is a bit sketched out and cautious. Molly asked her friend to send his usual route to her as she is unfamiliar with that neighborhood/area. Molly needed to check every single alley, neighborhood and street to make sure that they don’t encounter any issues.
